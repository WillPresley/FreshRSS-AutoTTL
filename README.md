# FreshRSS-AutoTTL extension

A FreshRSS extension for automatic feed refresh TTL based on the average frequency of entries.

# Configuration

The extension has a single configurable value - the max TTL which is 1 day by default.
Feed update interval is at least once per max TTL but no more often than the default TTL.

When a feed becomes idle (the last entry is more than 2x max TTL ago), the feed update interval will fall to max TTL
until the feed becomes active again.

It is recommended to configure each feed to use the default TTL. This will let AutoTTL work most efficiently.
